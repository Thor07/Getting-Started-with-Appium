# Getting Started with Appium

## 2 - Simple Selenium Test

One you've completed the setup steps
by downloading and installing all the development tools,
you're ready to get started.

To begin, create a simple Selenium script and run it against Sauce Labs.
See the following example:

https://github.com/saucelabs-training/Getting-Started-with-Appium/blob/master/src/test/java/SimpleAppiumWebTest.java

Note that it needs you to set SAUCE_USERNAME and SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY.

You can paste this data into your code,
or the test will pick it up from an environment variable.

This is a good security practice so that you don't accidentally share your credentials
(by checking them into a public github repository, for instance.)
